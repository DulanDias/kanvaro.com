# Using Kanban Boards

## What This Is

Kanban boards provide a visual way to manage tasks and track workflow progress. Tasks are represented as cards that move through columns representing different stages of work. This method is particularly effective for agile development, content creation, and any process with defined stages.

## Basic Theory

Kanban is based on the Toyota Production System and focuses on:

- **Visual Workflow**: Make work visible through cards and columns
- **Limit Work in Progress**: Prevent bottlenecks by limiting tasks in each stage
- **Continuous Flow**: Optimize the flow of work through the system
- **Pull System**: Work is pulled to the next stage when capacity is available

### Core Concepts

- **Cards**: Represent individual tasks or work items
- **Columns**: Represent different stages of the workflow
- **Swimlanes**: Horizontal divisions for different types of work
- **WIP Limits**: Maximum number of cards allowed in each column

## Prerequisites

- Kanvaro project with tasks created
- Appropriate permissions to view and edit tasks
- Understanding of your team's workflow stages

## Step-by-Step Kanban Setup

### Step 1: Access Kanban Board

1. **Navigate to Project**: Go to your project dashboard
2. **Select Kanban View**: Click "Kanban" in the view selector
3. **Board Overview**: Review the default board layout

### Step 2: Configure Board Columns

1. **Default Columns**: Kanvaro provides standard columns:
   - **To Do**: Tasks ready to start
   - **In Progress**: Currently active tasks
   - **Review**: Tasks awaiting review
   - **Done**: Completed tasks

2. **Customize Columns**:
   - **Add Column**: Click "+ Add Column" to create new stages
   - **Rename Column**: Click column header to edit name
   - **Reorder Columns**: Drag columns to reorder
   - **Delete Column**: Remove unnecessary columns

3. **Column Settings**:
   - **WIP Limits**: Set maximum cards per column
   - **Color Coding**: Assign colors to columns
   - **Description**: Add column descriptions

### Step 3: Configure Swimlanes

1. **Enable Swimlanes**: Toggle swimlane view
2. **Swimlane Options**:
   - **By Assignee**: Group tasks by team member
   - **By Priority**: Group by task priority
   - **By Epic**: Group by project epic
   - **By Type**: Group by task type

3. **Custom Swimlanes**: Create custom grouping options

### Step 4: Customize Card Display

1. **Card Information**:
   - **Title**: Task name
   - **Assignee**: Assigned team member
   - **Priority**: Task priority level
   - **Due Date**: Task deadline
   - **Story Points**: Effort estimation

2. **Card Colors**:
   - **Priority Colors**: Red (High), Yellow (Medium), Green (Low)
   - **Status Colors**: Based on task status
   - **Custom Colors**: Assign custom colors

3. **Card Icons**:
   - **Task Type**: Icons for different task types
   - **Attachments**: Paperclip for files
   - **Comments**: Speech bubble for discussions

### Step 5: Set Up Workflow Rules

1. **Automation Rules**:
   - **Auto-assign**: Automatically assign tasks based on rules
   - **Status Changes**: Auto-update status based on conditions
   - **Notifications**: Send alerts on status changes

2. **Validation Rules**:
   - **Required Fields**: Ensure required information is filled
   - **Dependencies**: Check task dependencies
   - **Approvals**: Require approval for status changes

## Using the Kanban Board

### Moving Tasks

1. **Drag and Drop**: Drag cards between columns
2. **Status Updates**: Automatically update task status
3. **Assignee Changes**: Update task assignments
4. **Priority Updates**: Change task priorities

### Task Management

1. **Create Tasks**: Add new tasks directly to the board
2. **Edit Tasks**: Click cards to edit task details
3. **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple cards for batch operations
4. **Filter Tasks**: Use filters to focus on specific tasks

### Collaboration Features

1. **Comments**: Add comments to task cards
2. **Mentions**: @mention team members in comments
3. **Attachments**: Add files to task cards
4. **Activity Feed**: Track all task activities

## Advanced Kanban Features

### WIP Limits

1. **Set Limits**: Configure maximum cards per column
2. **Visual Indicators**: See when limits are exceeded
3. **Alerts**: Get notified when limits are reached
4. **Optimization**: Adjust limits based on team capacity

### Analytics and Reporting

1. **Cycle Time**: Measure time from start to completion
2. **Throughput**: Track tasks completed per time period
3. **Bottleneck Analysis**: Identify workflow bottlenecks
4. **Team Performance**: Monitor individual and team productivity

### Integration Features

1. **Time Tracking**: Track time spent on tasks
2. **Calendar Sync**: Sync with external calendars
3. **Email Integration**: Send updates via email
4. **API Access**: Integrate with external tools

## Best Practices

### Board Design

1. **Keep It Simple**: Start with basic columns
2. **Team Input**: Involve team in column design
3. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and adjust
4. **Documentation**: Document workflow rules

### Workflow Optimization

1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Look for columns with too many cards
2. **Balance Workload**: Distribute work evenly
3. **Reduce Handoffs**: Minimize transitions between stages
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly optimize the process

### Team Collaboration

1. **Daily Standups**: Use board for daily meetings
2. **Visual Communication**: Make work visible to all
3. **Shared Understanding**: Ensure everyone understands the workflow
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep the board current

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Cards Not Moving**
- Check user permissions
- Verify column settings
- Review workflow rules
- Contact administrator

**Missing Tasks**
- Check task filters
- Verify project membership
- Review task assignments
- Check task visibility settings

**Performance Issues**
- Reduce number of cards displayed
- Optimize board filters
- Check browser performance
- Contact support if needed

### Optimization Tips

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Archive completed tasks
2. **Limit Columns**: Keep number of columns manageable
3. **Clear Labels**: Use descriptive column names
4. **Team Training**: Ensure team understands the workflow
